> Set and Set(immutable) compare
<br><br>

> the difference:<br><br>
Set is a class, so we need to use <b>new</b> key words when create a new Set instance.<br>
While Set(immutable) is only a factory function, so We can't use the new keyword during construction.
<br><br>the Set(immutatble) is immutable.
